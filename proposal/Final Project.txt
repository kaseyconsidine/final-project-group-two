Final Project: Museum Micro-Site ProposalEmilee LampertKasey ConsidineCody PutmanWill Cross	We plan to create a site that allows students to submit playlist ideas for the main exhibit in the museum.  On the site, students will be able to submit up to three song requests.  These requests will be sent to a database that will be compiled by a WRFL DJ.  The DJ will create a two hour-long playlist from the songs requested.  The art museum and WRFL will work together to set a monthly date to broadcast these songs.  Students will be able to hear their requests potentially while they view the artwork.  This will add a change in atmosphere and hopefully, draw a crowd to the museum during that time. 	The goal of this site is to help students customize their art museum experience as well as energize the environment.        Qualitative data will be gathered by informal interviews with Stuart Horodner and WRFL staff to see if they would be will to participate in the event.  We plan to ask when the best time would be to do this, and if it is possible.        We can poll art museum visitors about their experience after the event.  We will see if our event was successful in getting people to come, and if it was easy to submit requests through the site.  	      We plan to use Facebook to advertise the event and WRFL to also advertise and play during the event.
